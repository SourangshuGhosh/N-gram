<doc id="1482" title="Ask and Embla">
In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (from Old Norse "Askr ok Embla")—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, one of whom is Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.

<doc id="1789" title="Apuleius">
Apuleius (; also called Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis, Berber: "Afulay"; c. 125 – c. 180 C.E.) was a Latin-language prose writer. He was a Numidian Berber and lived during the Roman period. He was from Madaurus (now M'Daourouch, Algeria). He studied Platonist philosophy in Athens; travelled to Italy, Asia Minor and Egypt; and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty "tour de force" in his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. This is known as the "Apologia".

<doc id="17100" title="Kingfisher">
Kingfishers are a group of small to medium sized brightly coloured birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species being found in the Old World and Australasia. The group is treated either as a single family, Alcedinidae, or as a suborder Alcedines containing three families, Alcedinidae (river kingfishers), Halcyonidae (tree kingfishers), and Cerylidae (water kingfishers). There are roughly 90 species of kingfisher. All have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with little differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey as well as fish, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. Like other members of their order they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word 'kingfisher' normally refers to the Common Kingfisher.

<doc id="23362" title="History of Pakistan">
The history of Pakistan () encompasses the history of the region constituting modern Pakistan. Prior to independence in 1947, the land that is now Pakistan was ruled in different periods by local kings and numerous imperial powers. The ancient history of the region comprising present-day Pakistan also includes some of the oldest empires of South Asia and some of its major civilizations. By the 18th century the land was incorporated into British India. Pakistan's political history began with the birth of the All India Muslim League in 1906 to protect "Muslim interests, amid neglect and under-representation" and to oppose Congress and growing Indian nationalism in return the British Raj would decide to grant local self-rule. On 29 December 1930, philosopher Sir Muhammad Iqbal called for an autonomous new state in "northwestern India for Indian Muslims". The League rose to popularity in the late 1930s. Muhammad Ali Jinnah espoused the Two Nation Theory and led the League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, demanding the formation of independent states in the East and the West of British India. Eventually, a successful movement led by Jinnah gained independence from the British, on 14 August 1947.

Perry Mason is a fictional character, a defense attorney who was the main character in works of detective fiction written by Erle Stanley Gardner. Perry Mason was featured in more than 80 novels and short stories, most of which had a plot involving his client's murder trial. Typically, Mason was able to establish his client's innocence by implicating another character, who then confessed. Gardner, who was one of the best-selling authors of all time, had "135 million copies of his books in print in America alone in the year of his death" in 1970. The character of Perry Mason was portrayed each weekday on a long-running radio series, followed by well-known depictions on film and television, including "television's most successful and longest-running lawyer series" Perry Mason from 1957 to 1966 starring Raymond Burr; another series, The New Perry Mason starring Monte Markham, from 1973 to 1974; and 26 made-for-TV movies starring Burr filmed from 1985 to Burr's death in 1993.

<doc id="72339" title="Blackberry">
The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the "Rubus" genus in the Rosaceae family, hybrids among these species within the "Rubus" subgenus, and hybrids between the "Rubus" and "Idaeobatus" subgenera. What distinguishes the blackberry from its raspberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) 'picks-with' (ie stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus does stay with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains on the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit. The term 'bramble', a word meaning any impenetrable scrub, has traditionally been applied specifically to the blackberry or its products, though in the United States it applies to all members of the "Rubus" genus. In the western US, the term caneberry is used to refer to blackberries and raspberries as a group rather than the term bramble.

<doc id="140305" title="Lithic reduction">
Lithic reduction involves the use of a hard hammer precursor, such as a hammerstone, a soft hammer fabricator (made of wood, bone or antler), or a wood or antler punch to detach lithic flakes from a lump of tool stone called a lithic core (also known as the "objective piece"). As flakes are detached in sequence, the original mass of stone is reduced; hence the term for this process. Lithic reduction may be performed in order to obtain sharp flakes, on which a variety of tools can be made, or to rough out a blank for later refinement into a projectile point, knife, or other object. Flakes of regular size that are at least twice as long as they are broad are called blades. Lithic tools produced this way may be bifacial (exhibiting flaking on both sides) or unifacial (exhibiting flaking on one side only).

The operation was to include an experimental artillery action. Major General Tudor, Commander Royal Artillery (CRA) of the 9th Division, suggested trying out new artillery-infantry techniques on his sector of the front. During preparations, J. F. C. Fuller, a staff officer with the Royal Tank Corps (RTC), was in the process of looking for a place to use tanks as raiding parties.

<doc id="292239" title="Transitive closure">
In mathematics, the transitive closure of a binary relation "R" on a set "X" is the transitive relation "R"+ on set "X" such that "R"+ contains "R" and "R"+ is minimal (Lidl and Pilz 1998:337). If the binary relation itself is transitive, then the transitive closure is that same binary relation; otherwise, the transitive closure is a different relation. For example, if "X" is a set of airports and "x R y" means "there is a direct flight from airport "x" to airport "y"", then the transitive closure of "R" on "X" is the relation "R"+: "it is possible to fly from "x" to "y" in one or more flights."

<doc id="354679" title="Road traffic safety">
Road traffic safety refers to methods and measures for reducing the risk of a person using the road network being killed or seriously injured. The users of a road include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, their passengers, and passengers of on-road public transport, mainly buses and trams. Best-practice road safety strategies focus upon the prevention of serious injury and death crashes in spite of human fallibility (which is contrasted with the old road safety paradigm of simply reducing crashes assuming road user compliance with traffic regulations). Safe road design is now about providing a road environment which ensures vehicle speeds will be within the human tolerances for serious injury and death wherever conflict points exist. Furthermore, the highest possible degree of safety shall be ensured when transporting goods by road. It is of vital importance to monitor and validate the road transportation safety, including comprehensive checks on drivers, vehicles and safety processes.

<doc id="432932" title="Honey bee race">
Honey bee race is a classifications of honey bees, in particular European dark bees ("Apis mellifera mellifera") into various named instances of an informal taxonomic rank of race, below that of subspecies, on the basis of shared genetic traits. Pure representatives of any race are becoming ever rarer because humans have imported favored subspecies to regions that previously had distinctive type(s) of their own, and the imported bees have interbred with the native bees. The best chance to find representatives of any subspecies is in the center or the most protected part of the subspecies' native area. In the Americas, there has been a great deal of mixing of subspecies (and European dark bee "races") of the European honey bee ("A. mellifera") more generally, since all American honey bees have been imported at some point after 1492. Lacking systematic and widespread DNA analyses it is difficult to estimate which subspecies predominate there, and it is probably more realistic to treat most feral populations as belonging to undefined hybrid lineages. Among beekeepers, the term "race" has been used increasingly imprecisely, and is often used to refer to bee subspecies and hybrids as well as sub-subspecific divisions more properly.

<doc id="478346" title="Algebraically compact module">
In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory, algebraically compact modules, also called pure-injective modules, are modules that have a certain "nice" property which allows the solution of infinite systems of equations in the module by finitary means. The solutions to these systems allow the extension of certain kinds of module homomorphisms. These algebraically compact modules are analogous to injective modules, where one can extend all module homomorphisms. All injective modules are algebraically compact, and the analogy between the two is made quite precise by a category embedding.

<doc id="487908" title="Motor learning">
Motor learning is a "relatively permanent" change, resulting from practice or a novel experience, in the capability for responding (Guthrie, 1952). It often involves improving the smoothness and accuracy of movements and is obviously necessary for complicated movements such as speaking, playing the piano, and climbing trees; but it is also important for calibrating simple movements like reflexes, as parameters of the body and environment change over time. Motor learning research often considers variables that contribute to motor program formation (i.e., underlying skilled motor behaviour), the sensitivity of error-detection processes (Adams, 1971; Schmidt, 1975), and the strength of movement schemas (see motor program; Schmidt, 1975). The "relatively permanent" aspect is important, as it implies the capability to respond appropriately is acquired and retained. As a result, the temporary processes that affect behaviour during practice or experience should not be considered learning, but rather transient performance effects. As such, the main components underlying the behavioural approach to motor learning are structure of practice and feedback given. The former pertains to the manipulation of timing and organization of practice (potentially for different subtasks or variations of the task) for optimal information retention (also see varied practice), while the latter pertains to the influence of feedback on the preparation, anticipation, and guidance of movement.

<doc id="647729" title="Ambiguous grammar">
In computer science, an ambiguous grammar is a formal grammar for which there exists a string that can have more than one leftmost derivation, while an unambiguous grammar is a formal grammar for which every valid string has a unique leftmost derivation. Many languages admit both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, while some languages admit only ambiguous grammars. Any non-empty language admits an ambiguous grammar by taking an unambiguous grammar and introducing a duplicate rule or synonym (the only language without ambiguous grammars is the empty language). A language that only admits ambiguous grammars is called an inherently ambiguous language, and there are inherently ambiguous context-free languages. Deterministic context-free grammars are always unambiguous, and are an important subclass of unambiguous CFGs; there are non-deterministic unambiguous CFGs, however.

He became known by the nickname "Hard-Hittin'" Mark Whiten. Whiten was born in Pensacola, Florida. He was selected by Toronto in the 1986 amateur draft and made his major league debut in the '90 season. Whiten was a typical up-and-down player. He had one of the best outfield arms in the 1990s. He hit for power too, but his mental lapses hurt him in the field and at the plate. The Blue Jays had little patience with his development and sent him to Cleveland.

Tales from the Crypt is a 1972 British horror film, directed by Freddie Francis. It is an anthology film consisting of five separate segments, based on stories from EC Comics.

The reason for this, according to "Creepy" founding editor Russ Jones, is that Amicus producer Milton Subotsky did not own a run of the original EC comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by Jones. The story "Wish You Were Here" was reprinted in the paperback collection The Vault of Horror (Ballantine, 1965). The other four stories in the movie were among the eight stories reprinted in "Tales from the Crypt" (Ballantine, 1964). It was produced by Amicus Productions and filmed at Shepperton Studios.

<doc id="1190581" title="Critical opalescence">
Critical opalescence is a phenomenon which arises in the region of a continuous, or second-order, phase transition. Originally reported by Thomas Andrews in 1869 for the liquid-gas transition in carbon dioxide, many other examples have been discovered since. The phenomenon is most commonly demonstrated in binary fluid mixtures, such as methanol and cyclohexane. As the critical point is approached, the sizes of the gas and liquid region begin to fluctuate over increasingly large length scales. As the density fluctuations become of a size comparable to the wavelength of light, the light is scattered and causes the normally transparent liquid to appear cloudy. Tellingly, the opalescence does not diminish as one gets closer to the critical point, where the largest fluctuations can reach even centimetre proportions, confirming the physical relevance of smaller fluctuations.

The Maryport & Carlisle Railway (M&CR) was a small but highly profitable railway formed in 1836 to connect the town of Maryport to the county town (strictly speaking, city) of Carlisle and to allow the output of collieries inland of Maryport to be more cheaply transported to Maryport for onward movement by sea. Its headquarters and locomotive works were at Maryport. After overcoming early mismanagement, its limited extent, the large volume of coal traffic, and the absence of competition made it one of the most profitable (and most consistently profitable) pre-grouping railway companies in Britain. At grouping in 1923 the M&C became a part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The main Carlisle- Maryport line (completed in 1845) remains open and forms part of the Cumbrian Coast Line between Carlisle and Barrow in Furness.

<doc id="1385717" title="Lions led by donkeys">
"Lions led by donkeys" is a phrase popularly used to describe the British infantry of World War I and to condemn the generals who commanded them. The contention is that the brave soldiers (lions) were sent to their deaths by incompetent and indifferent leaders (donkeys). The phrase was the source of the title of one of the most scathing examinations of British First World War generals, The Donkeys - a study of the 1915 Western Front offensives - by politician and writer of military histories Alan Clark. The book was representative of much First World War history produced in the 1960s and was not outside the mainstream—Basil Liddell Hart vetted Clark's drafts—and helped to form the predominant popular view of the First World War (in the English-speaking world) in the decades that followed. However, the work and its viewpoint of incompetent military leaders have both been subject to attempts at revisionism.

Motional Feedback (MFB) is the name of an active high fidelity loudspeaker system which was developed by the Dutch Philips brand in the early 1970s. The loudspeakers had built-in amplifiers and featured a revolutionary feedback sensor on the woofer. The sensor measured the output signal of the woofer and compared it to the amplifier input signal. This resulted in a very low distortion and furthermore a more extended low frequency response in a relatively small enclosure. Any distortion induced by the enclosure or the woofer itself is immediately corrected by the feedback loop.

<doc id="1679713" title="Kriegspiel (chess)">
Kriegspiel (German for "war game") is a chess variant invented by Henry Michael Temple in 1899 and based upon the original Kriegsspiel developed by Georg von Rassewitz in 1812. In this game each player can see their own pieces, but not those of their opponent. For this reason, it is necessary to have a third person (or computer) act as a referee, with full information about the progress of the game. When it is a player's turn he will attempt a move, which the referee will declare to be 'legal' or 'illegal'. If the move is illegal, the player tries again; if it is legal, that move stands. Each player is given information about checks and captures. They may also ask the referee if there are any legal captures with a pawn. Since the position of the opponent's pieces is unknown, Kriegspiel is not a game with perfect information. Chess Kriegspiel derives from a war game which was used in 19th century Germany to train military officers.

Meconopsis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It was first described by French botanist Viguier in 1814 who named it as poppy-like (gr. "Mekon" poppy, "Opsis" alike). The species have attractive flowers and have two distinct ranges. A single species, "Meconopsis cambrica" (Welsh Poppy), is indigenous to England, Wales, Ireland, and the fringes of Western Europe, although recent studies suggest that it does not belong in the genus. The other 40 or so (depending on classification) species are found in the Himalayas. Within the Himalayan types there is much debate as to what constitutes a particular species as many readily hybridise with each other and produce viable seed. It is likely that some individually named species are in fact a single species but with an under-appreciated morphological diversity.

<doc id="2585520" title="Irrigation in Saudi Arabia">
Center pivot irrigation in Saudi Arabia is typical of many isolated irrigation projects scattered throughout the arid and hyper-arid regions of the Earth. Nonrenewable Fossil water is mined from depths as great as 1 km (3,000 ft), pumped to the surface, and distributed via large centre pivot irrigation feeds. The circles of green irrigated vegetation may comprise a variety of agricultural commodities from alfalfa to wheat. Diameters of the normally circular fields range from a few hundred metres to as much as . The projects often trace out a narrow, sinuous, and seemingly random path. Actually, engineers generally seek ancient river channels now buried by the sand seas. The fossil waters mined in these projects accumulated during periods of wetter climate in the Pleistocene glacial epochs, between 10,000 to 2 million years ago, and are not being replenished under current climatic conditions. The projects, therefore, will have limited production as the reservoirs are drained. Water, of course, is the key to agriculture in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom has implemented a multifaceted program to provide the vast supplies of water necessary to achieve the spectacular growth of the agricultural sector. A network of dams has been built to trap and utilize precious seasonal floods. Vast underground water reservoirs have been tapped through deep wells. Desalination plants have been built to produce fresh water from the sea for urban and industrial use, thereby freeing other sources for agriculture. Facilities have also been put into place to treat urban and industrial run-off for agricultural irrigation. These efforts collectively have helped transform vast tracts of the desert into fertile farmland. Land under cultivation has grown from under in 1976 to more than 8 million acres (32,000 km2) in 1993.

Significant numbers of Jewish communities commenced to exist outside of the Land of Israel following the fall of the Israelite northern Kingdom of Israel in about the 720s BCE to the Assyrian Empire and of the southern Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE to the Babylonian Empire. These communities came into existence as a result of Jews fleeing the land before the onslaught of invading forces, because of forced deportations, or enslavement, and sometimes voluntarily. Some families or whole communities have had to move from one country to another because of persecutions, and some just ceased to exist. Though some form of contact had been maintained between most of the main Jewish communities in the diaspora over the millennia, contact had been lost with some communities, which came to be regarded by the mainstream communities as lost.

Some species are highly specialized (the most extreme case being monophagy), others less so, while some can tolerate many different environments. In other words, there is a continuum from highly specialized to broadly generalist species.

MacX is a display server implementation supporting the X11 display server protocol that ran on System 7, Mac OS 8, and Mac OS 9. It also ran under A/UX. Prior to X11R4 and the introduction of the PowerPC-based Power Macintosh, this server was developed internally by Apple Inc. for the Motorola 68000 based Macintoshes. MacX was initially developed within the Networking and Communications organization as one component of the Apple DEC Alliance suite of products, but later was moved to Apple's A/UX group since X11 was (and is) an important part of UNIX user interfaces. Versions supporting X11R4 and X11R5 were developed for Apple by a small team of engineers at AGE Logic, Inc., a San Diego, California company. AGE also OEMed the MacX software under the trade name XoftWare for Macintosh. Apple provided early versions of the Power Macintosh to AGE Logic, and the result was a binary that supported both the Power Macintosh as well as earlier, 68000-based systems.

The office of chamberlains was abolished in 1826, under the operation of 23 Geo. III, passed in 1783, but the custody of the standards and any duties connected therewith remained attached to an officer in the exchequer until that department was abolished in 1866. Meanwhile, in pursuance of recommendations of Standard Commissions of 1841 and 1854 and a House of Commons Committee of 1862, the Standards of Weights, Measures and Coinage Act 1866 was passed. This act created a special department of the Board of Trade, called the Standard Weights and Measures Department, and a head of that department styled the Warden of the Standards.

<doc id="7993337" title="Premise">
A premise is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion. In other words: a premise is an assumption that something is true. In logic, an argument requires a set of (at least) two declarative sentences (or "propositions") known as the premises along with another declarative sentence (or "proposition") known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure. More complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic.

<doc id="9760191" title="Tiger (guitar)">
Tiger was Jerry Garcia's main guitar from 1979 to 1989. It was built by Sonoma County luthier Doug Irwin. The Tiger is named after the tiger inlaid on the preamp cover located on the guitar's top, just behind the tailpiece. The body features several layers of wood laminated together face-to-face in a configuration referred to as a "Hippie sandwich" by employees of Alembic Inc., where Irwin worked for a brief period in the early 1970s. The combination of several heavy varieties of wood, plus solid brass binding and hardware results in an unusually heavy instrument that tips the scales at 131⁄2 pounds. After Garcia began using a new Irwin guitar (known as "Rosebud") in December 1989, Tiger became his backup guitar. Due to a problem with Rosebud during the Grateful Dead concert on July 9, 1995, Tiger was the last guitar Garcia played publicly.

Les brigands ("The Bandits") is an opéra bouffe, or operetta, by Jacques Offenbach to a French libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy. Meilhac and Halévy's libretto lampoons both serious (Schiller's play set to music by Verdi) and light theatre (Fra Diavolo and Les diamants de la couronne by Auber). The plot is cheerfully amoral in its presentation of theft as a basic principle of society rather than as an aberration. As Falsacappa, the brigand chieftain, notes: "Everybody steals according to their position in society". The piece premiered in Paris in 1869 and has received periodic revivals in France and elsewhere, both in French and in translation.

<doc id="10562714" title="Prescriptive authority for psychologists movement">
The Prescriptive authority for psychologists (RxP) movement is a public health initiative to give prescriptive authority to psychologists with 2 years of postdoctoral Masters degreed training, or Continuing Education training in clinical psychopharmacology and related sciences, followed by 1 – 2 years of supervised prescribing, or a Certificate from the Department of Defense program, or the Board Certified Diplomate from the Prescribing Psychologists Register (FICPP or FICPPM), www.pprpsych.com to enable them, according to state law, to prescribe psychotropic medications to treat mental and emotional disorders. Prior to RxP legislation and in states where it has not been passed, this role is played by psychiatrists, who possess a medical degree and thus the authority to prescribe medication (whose numbers, advocates assert, are at a critical shortage), and by primary care physicians who can prescribe psychotropics but (advocates argue) lack extensive training in psychotropic drugs and in diagnosing and treating psychological disorders. According to the American Psychological Association, the professional organization representing the interests of psychologists, the movement is a reaction to the growing public need for mental health services, particularly in less urbanized and therefore under-resourced areas where patients have little or no access to psychiatrists. Prescribing Psychologists' Register (PPR, or pprpsych.com) with Samuel Feldman, Ph.D., President, was the pioneer in first presenting such training for psychologists to prescribe,

The Long Ya Men's unique features assisted Zheng He in navigating the waters around Singapore during his seven maritime voyages to the west between 1405 and 1433 AD. The rocky outcrops were subsequently destroyed by the British in 1848 to widen the channel for larger vessels to sail through. In 2005, a symbolic replica was erected by the Singapore government near its original site to mark the role it played in Singapore's maritime history.

"Me and My Shadow" is a 1927 popular song.

The Blaze-winged Parakeet ("Pyrrhura devillei"), more commonly known as the Blaze-winged Conure in aviculture, is a species of parrot found in wooded habitats in the Pantanal-region of Brazil and Paraguay. It remains locally fairly common, but has suffered due to extensive habitat destruction within its relatively small range, and has therefore been uplisted to Near Threatened by BirdLife International in 2009. The type specimen is labelled Bolivia, but due to shifting borders it is now believed to be from Paraguay. It has often been considered a subspecies of the Maroon-bellied Parakeet based on apparent hybrids from Paraguay, but – as far as known – the two generally maintain their integrity, and are recent sources are undecided on whether to treat them as one species or two. They resemble each other, but the Blaze-winged Parakeet has a dusky crown and red "shoulder" and underwing coverts.

Bahibbik Wahashteeny ("I Love You, I Miss You") is the seventeenth full-length Arabic studio album from Egyptian pop singer Angham, launched in Egypt on July 25, 2005 (see 2005 in music) by Rotana Production Company. It was her second record on the label after "Bet'heb Meen" (Who Do You Love) which was released in 1997. The 2005 record has witnessed a critical success but commercial disappointment. "Bahibbik Wahashteeny" is perhaps the least sold record during Angham's entire singing career in the last 10 years, but improved its sale gradually upon the broadcast of its second single "Bahib Nafsi" (I Love Myself). However, despite the promotion and Angham's 2005 tour, the record had only a moderate success and Angham was unable to garner any hits from the album except "Albak" (Your Heart) and "Inta Meen" (Who Are You) which both caused a tremendous success around the Middle East and the Gulf countries, respectively. The record is available on both CD (57:44 minutes) and tape (50:38 minutes) format. The bonus track "Inta Meen" (Who Are You) and the remix of "Bahibbik Wahashteeny" are only featured on the CD version. In this record, Angham collaborated with many new faces. They include Hend elKady who worked with Angham for the first time as a music composer; her brother Khaled Suleiman and Ismael as new music arrangers; Ameer Teaima, Sultan Salah, Wissam Sabry, Khaled Abou elFateh and Fahd Thamal as the new lyricists.

Audata (Ancient Greek Αὐδάτη; ruled "c." 359 – 336 BC) was an Illyrian princess and later a Macedonian queen when she married Philip II of Macedon in 359 BC. She was the daughter or niece of Bardyllis, the Illyrian king of the Dardanian State. In order to concentrate on the internal struggle necessary to secure his crown, Philip reaffirmed the treaty the Dardanians had imposed on Macedonia by force of arms and sealed the alliance with Bardyllis by his marriage of Audata. This action undoubtedly deterred a full-scale Dardanian invasion of Macedonia at a time when the country was most vulnerable. Philip immediately consolidated his power as a result, so much that he defeated Bardylis in a decisive battle in 358 BC.

Research on this subject is still at an early stage.

The duchy probably extended inland as far as the Apennine Mountains, perhaps beyond, and its southernmost town was Humana (Numera) on the northern bank of the Misco.

<doc id="16798141" title="Pachystropheus">
Pachystropheus (After Greek "Pachys", "Thick" and "Strophaios", Vertebrae) is a genus of prehistoric reptile, possibly a choristodere (champsosaur), from the Rhaetian (Late Triassic) of southwestern England. It was named by Erika von Huene in 1935; Huene described "Pachystropheus" as a champsosaur, but this was overlooked for decades until its redescription by Storrs and Gower in 1993. This reevalution would extend the fossil record of champsosaurs back 45 million years. However, other authors consider attribution of "Pachystropheus" to Choristodera problematic, stating that it depends on vertebral and girdle characters that are also found in the skeletons of aquatic reptiles other than choristoderes; most of the diagnostic features of choristoderes are skull features, but the presence of these cannot be confirmed in "Pachystropheus", as there is no confirmed skull material for this taxon. Silvio Renesto (2005) found similarities in the postcranial skeleton of "Pachystropheus" and the thalattosaur genus Endennasaurus; according to Renesto, these similarities may indicate that "Pachystropheus" and "Endennasaurus" are close relatives, but they might as well simply be a case of a convergent evolution triggered by the aquatic lifestyle of both taxa.

Uganda is a source and destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Ugandan children are trafficked within the country, as well as to Canada, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Karamojong women and children are sold in cattle markets or by intermediaries and forced into situations of domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, herding, and begging. Security companies in Kampala recruit Ugandans to serve as security guards in Iraq where, at times, their travel documents and pay have reportedly been withheld as a means to prevent their departure; these cases may constitute trafficking. Pakistani, Indian, and Chinese workers are reportedly trafficked to Uganda, and Indian networks traffic Indian children to the country for sexual exploitation. Children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R.C.), Rwanda, and Burundi are trafficked to Uganda for agricultural labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Until August 2006, the terrorist rebel organization, Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), abducted children and adults in northern Uganda to serve as soldiers, sex slaves, and porters; while no further abductions of Ugandan children have been reported, at least 300 additional people, mostly children, were abducted during the reporting period in the Central African Republic and the D.R.C. The Government of Uganda does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.

These are believed to be glacial erratics or result from a similar glacier process. On the west side of the hill, near grid reference NX458831, a few hundred meters from the summit is an F-111E Aardvark crash site. The site is marked by a small memorial to the two US Airforce pilots who were killed in the accident (Captains Spaulding and Hetzner). Although the crash happened on December 19, 1979 there are still small amounts of aircraft debris in the area.

<doc id="21412510" title="Non-reversing mirror">
A Non-reversing mirror (sometimes marketed as a "True mirror") is a mirror that presents its subject as it would be seen from the mirror. A non-reversing mirror can be made by connecting two regular mirrors at their edges at a 90 degree angle. If the join is positioned so that it is vertical, an observer looking into the angle will see a non-reversed image. This can be seen in public toilets when there are mirrors on two walls which are at right angles. Looking towards the corner, such an image is visible. The problem with this type of non-reversing mirror is that there is a big line down the middle interrupting the image. However, if first surface mirrors are used, and care is taken to set the angle to exactly 90 degrees, the join can be made invisible.

<doc id="23003925" title="Scalloped topography">
Scalloped topography is common in the mid-latitudes of Mars, between 45° and 60° north and south. It is particularly prominent in the region of Utopia Planitia, in the northern hemisphere, and in the region of Peneus and Amphitrites Patera in the southern hemisphere. Such topography consists of shallow, rimless depressions with scalloped edges, commonly referred to as "scalloped depressions" or simply "scallops". Scalloped depressions can be isolated or clustered and sometimes seem to coalesce. A typical scalloped depression displays a gentle equator-facing slope and a steeper pole-facing scarp. This topographic asymmetry is probably due to differences in insolation. Scalloped depressions are believed to form from the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (direct transition of a material from the solid to the gas phase with no intermediate liquid stage). This process may still be happening at present. In Utopia Planitia, a series of curvilinear ridges parallel to the scarp are etched on the floor of large scalloped depressions, possibly representing different stages of scarp erosion. Recently, other researchers have advanced an idea that the ridges represent the tops of layers. Sometimes the surface around scalloped terrain or scalloped topography displays "patterned ground", characterized by a regular pattern of polygonal fractures. These patterns indicate that the surface has undergone stress, perhaps caused by subsidence, desiccation, or thermal contraction. Such patterns are common in periglacial areas on Earth. Scalloped terrains in Utopia Planitia display polygonal features of different sizes: small (about 5–10 m across) on the scarp, and larger (30–50 m across) on the surrounding terrains. These scale differences may indicate local difference in ground ice concentrations.

<doc id="31570900" title="Somatic embryogenesis">
Somatic embryogenesis is a process where a plant or embryo is derived from a single somatic cell or group of somatic cells. Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form from the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Somatic embryos are mainly produced in vitro and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid nutrient media which contain plant growth regulators (PGR’s). The main PGRs used are auxins but can contain cytokinin in a smaller amount. Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types. Somatic embryogenesis has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement. The first documentation of somatic embryogenesis was by Steward et al. in 1958 and Reinert in 1959 with carrot cell suspension cultures.

The modern welfare state has been criticized on economic and moral grounds from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. On the one hand, socialists typically criticize the welfare state as an attempt to legitimize the economic system of capitalism by making it appear more equitable, while failing to resolve any of its fundamental contradictions and further distorting the market through policy interventions. By contrast, liberal conservatives usually criticize the welfare state on moral grounds, arguing that the provision of basic services or transfer payments reduces the incentive for workers to seek employment.

<doc id="33977879" title="Infrared sensing in vampire bats">
Vampire bats are the only known mammals whose entire nutrition relies on blood from mammals or birds. In the family Phyllostomidae and the subfamily Desmodontinae, there are three known species of vampire bats : "Desmodus rotundus" (common vampire bat), "Diphylla ecaudata" (hairy-legged vampire bat), and "Diaemus youngi" (white-winged vampire bat). Most of the referenced research on infrared sensing in vampire bats has been done on the common vampire bat because this is the most commonly found species. These bats have developed a specialized system using infrared-sensitive receptors on their nose-leaf to prey on homeothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates. Trigeminal nerve fibers that innervate these IR-sensitive receptors may be involved in detection of infrared thermal radiation emitted by their prey. This may aid bats in locating blood-rich areas on their prey. In addition, neuroanatomical and molecular research has suggested possible similarities of IR-sensing mechanisms between vampire bats and IR-sensitive snakes. Infrared sensing in vampire bats has not yet been hypothesized to be image forming, as it was for IR-sensitive snakes. While the literature on IR-sensing in vampire bats is thin, progress continues to made in this field to identify how vampire bats can sense and use infrared thermal radiation.

<doc id="34000456" title="Surface wave detection by animals">
Surface wave detection by animals is the process by which animals, such as surface-feeding fish are able to sense and localize prey and other objects on the surface of a body of water by analyzing features of the ripples generated by objects' movement at the surface. Features analyzed include waveform properties such as frequency, change in frequency, and amplitude, and the curvature of the wavefront. A number of different species are proficient in surface wave detection, including some aquatic insects and toads, though most research is done on the topminnow/surface killfish Aplocheilus lineatus." The fish and other animals with this ability spend large amounts of time near the water surface, some just to feed and others their entire lives.

Lunar pareidolia refers to the pareidolic images seen by humans on the face of the Moon. The Moon's surface is a complex mixture of dark areas (the lunar "maria", or "seas") and lighter areas (the highlands). Many cultures have seen shapes in these dark and light areas that have reminded them of people, animals or objects, often related to their folklore; the most famous are the Man in the Moon in Western folklore and the Moon Rabbit of Asia and the Americas. Other cultures perceive the silhouette of a woman, a frog, a moose, a buffalo, or a dragon (with its head and mouth to the right and body and wings to the left) in the full moon. Alternatively, the vague shape of the overall dark and light regions can resemble a Yin Yang symbol.

<doc id="39614047" title="The Eleventh">
The Eleventh is the (apparent) first studio album by the Denver, Colorado based industrial metal band Rorschach Test. It was released in 1996 according to the band's official webpage, however Discogs puts the release in 1994 (a specification consistent with other websites including last.fm, and spirit-of-metal.com; however this data is likely to be copied from the Discogs database). Discogs also provides another snippet which it is not possible to confirm from internet sources, in that the album's insert "has a sticker over the band lineup which adds a rhythm guitar player. This could be either a last minute lineup change or they just screwed up the printing .". Another unconformity concerning this album is that allmusic.com describes Rorschach Test's (according to the band's official website, "sophomore" album), Unclean, as their debut, which lends further to the confusion over this particular recording. This is probably why there has never been a wikipedia page regarding this album until now.

<doc id="40649553" title="Cucurbita cylindrata">
Cucurbita cylindrata is a species of flowering plant in the squash family. It is similar to Cucurbita californica, Cucurbita cordata, Cucurbita digitata, and Cucurbita palmata and all these species hybridize readily. These species form the only restricted xerophyte species group in the genus Cucurbita. Each member of this species group is native to the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico where they are relatively uncommon. Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well-drained. "C. cylindrata" is found only in the middle portion of Baja California, mostly in Baja California Sur. Botanists Bemis and Whitaker suggest that "C. cordata" and "C. cylindrata" may be a case of sympatric speciation. The juvenile leaves of "C. cylindrata", "C. cordata", "C. digitata", and "C. palmata" show a high degree of similarity, but their mature leaves are visibly different, as are their root structures. "C. cylindrata" fruits are dark green, striped, and round.
